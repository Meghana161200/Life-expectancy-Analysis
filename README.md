# Life-expectancy-Analysis
Statistical analysis of global life expectancy with Regression, Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, and assumption diagnostics.
---

#Dataset Overview

- **Rows**: ~2,900
- **Features**: Country, year, alcohol consumption, status, gdp, population , health indicators, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `life_expectancy` (in years)

---

# Project Objectives

- Perform hypothesis testing to determine statistically significant differences.
- Build linear regression models to understand relationships with life expectancy.
- Compare models using ANOVA to evaluate improvement with interaction terms.
- Conduct assumption checks to validate linear model integrity.
